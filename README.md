**Linear Regression with One Hot Encoding using pandas library**\
Given carprices.csv, train a model implementing Linear Regression with One Hot Encoding and predict the following:
- Price of Mercedes Benz that is 4y old with 45,000 mileage
- Price of BMW X5 that is 7y old with 86,000 mileage
- Accuracy Score of the model

**Kaggle HR Data Analytics**\
Given HR_data.csv, analyse the following:
- Prima facie reason for employee attrition
- Impact of salary on employee retention
- Department-wise employee attrition vs retention

**Titanic survival prediction based on age and ticket fare**\
Given titanic.csv, do the following:
- clean up the data
- identify input and target data
- train using Decision Tree and check the accuracy
- perform sample prediction on test and random data

**KFold Cross Validation**\
Use the inbuilt Iris data set of Scikit Learn\
Check the accuracy of the following models:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines
- Random Forest

Compare the above using StratifiedKFold manually with 3 folds.\
Next compare the manual results with Scikit Learn's inbuilt function - cross_val_score

**KMeans Clustering**\
Given income.csv, using Age and Income features:
- Confirm if KMeans algorithm identifies the same clusters as we do visually
- Scale the data using pre-processing for correct clustering
- Reconfirm optimal cluster count k using Elbow method
